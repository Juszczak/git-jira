# git-jira
ðŸ¤– Automation tool that fetches data from Jira API by current git branch and uses prepare-commit-msg hook

# Install
1. Install dependencies by typing `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Set up your project to use git-jira by typing: `./install path/to/project/root`
3. Set up Jira credentials as environment variables:
```bash
  export GIT_JIRA_USER=your_username
  export GIT_JIRA_PASSWORD=your_password
  export GIT_JIRA_URL=your_jira_hostname_with_port
```

# Usage
The tool uses [prepare-commit-msg](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook,
so all you need to do is just `git commit` as usual.

> For performance purposes, the script fetches only *unresolved* issues *assigned to the current user*

# Uninstall
Run `./uninstall path/to/project/root`
